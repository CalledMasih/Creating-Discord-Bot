After the operation was processed with any error, please create a NEW file with
```
CTRL + Alt + Windows + N
```
and set the name to anything you want such as: `index.js`, `bot.js`, `main.js`

Then Upload the source of this repository along with your personal information for example: `botToken`, `prefix`, `voiceChannelId` and `rgbRoleId` in the [config.json](https://github.com/Masihdeveloper/Creating-Discord-Bot/blob/main/config.json) file
