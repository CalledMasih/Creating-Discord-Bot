Before you get started anything you need to create your NEW Application bot in [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications?new_application=true), Then copy and save your Application Bot's TOKEN (Please don't share this with anyone, Because whoever has it will have full access to your bot, for example they can Nuked your server!)
**Make sure that your Bot have access to the Intents in the Portal.**

```
CTRL + J

and then
```

After the operation was processed with any error, please create a NEW file with
```
CTRL + Alt + Windows + N
```
and set the name to anything you want such as: `index.js`, `bot.js`, `main.js`

Then Upload the source of this repository along with your personal information for example: `botToken`, `prefix`, `voiceChannelId` and `rgbRoleId` in the [config.json](https://github.com/CalledMasih/Creating-Discord-Bot/blob/main/config.json) file.
